# CodeAlpha Image Recognition Project

Welcome to the CodeAlpha Image Recognition project repository!

## Overview
This project aims to develop an image recognition system using machine learning techniques. We utilize the CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

## Objectives
- Train a CNN model to accurately classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set.
- Explore insights and findings from the image recognition process.

## Methodology
- Preprocess the dataset by normalizing pixel values and splitting it into training and testing sets.
- Design and train a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Compile the model with appropriate optimizer and loss function.
- Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 0.7121000289916992 on the test set.
- Visualized training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs.
- Successfully demonstrated the model's ability to recognize various objects.

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the image recognition model.
- `README.md`: You're currently reading it! This file provides an overview of the project.

## Usage
